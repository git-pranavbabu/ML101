# ML101

A personal learning repository where I explore, implement, and document various **machine learning algorithms**.  
This project serves as both a study resource and a practical playground for experimenting with ML concepts.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn the fundamentals of machine learning step by step.
- Implement classic algorithms from scratch to deepen understanding.
- Compare implementations with library-based solutions (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch).
- Build recall-friendly notes and examples for future reference.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
Planned algorithms and concepts include:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)
- Neural Networks (basic feedforward, CNN, RNN)
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
